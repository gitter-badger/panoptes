ColumnIndexField: SnpName            #The column name in ColumnDataTable that maps into ColumnIndexArray, note that "AutoKey" can be used if your rows do not have Unique IDs
ColumnIndexArray: col_index          #1D Array in HDF5 that gives the value of ColumnDataField for each column,
                                     #if this is missing then it is assumed that the HDF5 columns are in the same
                                     #order as the "ColumnDataTable" sorted by "ColumnIndexField"
